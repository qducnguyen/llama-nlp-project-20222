# ðŸ’¬ðŸš€ LLM as a Chatbot Service

![](https://i.ibb.co/gW7yKj9/2023-05-26-3-31-06.png)

The purpose of this repository is to let people to use lots of open sourced instruction-following fine-tuned LLM models as a Chatbot service. Because different models behave differently, and different models require differently formmated prompts, I made a very simple library [`Ping Pong`](https://github.com/deep-diver/PingPong) for model agnostic conversation and context managements. Also, I made [`GradioChat`](https://github.com/deep-diver/gradio-chat) UI looking similar to [HuggingChat](https://huggingface.co/chat/) but entirely built in Gradio. Those two projects are fully integrated to power this project. 

### Easiest way to try out

This project has become the one of the default framework at [jarvislabs.ai](https://jarvislabs.ai/). Jarvislabs.ai is one of the cloud GPU VM provider with the cheapest GPU prices. Furthermore, all the weights of the supported popular open source LLMs are pre-downloaded. You don't need to waste of your money and time to wait until download hundreds of GBs to try out a collection of LLMs. In less than 10 minutes, you can try out any model. 
- for further instruction, please follow the [official documentation](https://jarvislabs.ai/docs/llmchat)

### Context management

Different model might have different strategies to manage context, so if you want to know the exact strategies applied to each model, take a look at the [`chats`](https://github.com/deep-diver/LLM-As-Chatbot/tree/main/chats) directory. However, here are the basic ideas that I have come up with initially. I have found long prompts will slow down the generation process a lot eventually, so I thought the prompts should be kept as short as possible while as concise as possible at the same time. In the previous version, I have accumulated all the past conversations, and that didn't go well.

- In every turn of the conversation, the past `N` conversations will be kept. Think about the `N` as a hyper-parameter. As an experiment, currently the past 2-3 conversations are only kept for all models.
- (TBD) In every turn of the conversation, it summarizes or extract information. The summarized information will be given in the every next turn of conversation.

## Instructions

0. Prerequisites

Note that the code only works `Python >= 3.9` and `gradio >= 3.32.0`

```console
$ conda create -n llm-serve python=3.9
$ conda activate llm-serve
```

1. Install dependencies. `flash-attn` and `triton` are included to support `MPT` models, If you don't want to use `MPT`, comment them out, otherwise you will face two `module not found errors`, then you will have to install `packaging` and `torch` packages while facing the errors.
```console
$ cd LLM-As-Chatbot
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run Gradio application

```console
$ python app.py
```

## How to plugin your own model

You need to follow the following steps to bring your own models in this project.

1. Add your model spec in [`model_cards.json`](https://github.com/deep-diver/LLM-As-Chatbot/blob/main/model_cards.json). If you don't have thumnail image, just leave it as blank string(`""`).
2. Add the button for your model in [`app.py`](https://github.com/deep-diver/LLM-As-Chatbot/blob/2efbb004a1989483cbdbd57a6d2b808f966f516a/app.py#L405). Don't forget to give it a name in the `gr.Button` and `gr.Markdown`. For placeholders, their names are omitted. Assign the `gr.Button` to a variable with the name of your choice.
3. Add the button variable to the [button list](https://github.com/deep-diver/LLM-As-Chatbot/blob/2efbb004a1989483cbdbd57a6d2b808f966f516a/app.py#L559) in the `app.py`
4. Determine the model type in [`global_vars.py`](https://github.com/deep-diver/LLM-As-Chatbot/blob/2efbb004a1989483cbdbd57a6d2b808f966f516a/global_vars.py#L12). If you think your model is similar to one of the existings, just add a filtering rules(`if-else`) and give it the same name. 
5. (Optional) if your model is totally new one, you need to give a new `model_type` in `global_vars.py`, and make changes accordingly in `utils.py`, and `chats/central.py`.
